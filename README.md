# 3. - `Ip-Scrapper` <br>
  - This script accepts text that has ip address inline with text or purely ip address
  - The script gets to work as soon as information is just buffered on the pipe<br>
  - It Searches through the piped information for IP information <br>
  - It then fetches Ip information from [Ip to GeoInfor](http://ip-api.com/json/).
  - The information returned is in json format, we then pass the information through to awk ü¶Ö Command
  - The information is formated to the following structure.
  ```
  status -> success
  country -> United States
  countryCode -> US
  region -> FL
  regionName -> Florida
  city -> Tampa
  zip -> 33614
  lat ->28.0109
  lon ->-82.4948
  timezone -> America/New_York
  isp -> HIVELOCITY
  Inc.
  org -> NOC4Hosts Inc
  as -> AS29802 HIVELOCITY
  Inc.
  query -> 96.31.83.1
  ```
  - The command has an option argument `--save or -s` that tells the script whether to store the<br> information Scrapped or not.<br>
  - Sample of running the program<br>
  - `Some command that outputs text with ip | ipScrapper [ARGS]`<br>

  #### Installation instructions: <br>
  ```$ git clone <clone-url>;<br>
 $ cd Dir_name;
 $ target_file=./ipScrapper
 $ cd ipScrapper;
 $ sudo chmod +x $target_file
 $ sudo ln -s $(pwd)/target_file /usr/local/bin/target_file;
 $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/target_file /usr/local/sbin/target_file;

# 2. - `Git-Daemon`
  - This big guy is a GitHub-Cli wrapper that makes your day as a developer, easy <br>
 What does it do! you may ask, well the script provides the basic functionality of git <br>
 like pushing and pulling updates to local repository. <br>
   - The script also allows you, the user to add custom commit messages, if you don't provide, the script <br>
 will add a crafted commit message just right out of the box. So you as a developer can push changes quickly <br>
 The script automates pull / push request  and optionally forcing updates <br> online or offline using the -f. <br>

 - First thing after installing is typing `gitwrap -h`
to see it's usage <br>
 Installation instructions.<br>
 ```$ git clone <clone-url>;<br>
$ cd Dir_name;
$ cd Git-Daemon;
$ sudo chmod +x ./gmv2
$ sudo ln -s $(pwd)/gmv2 /usr/local/bin/;
$ sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/gitwrap /usr/local/bin/gmv2;
$ gitwrap -h
```

üôå You have your script on standby ready to execute<br>
Command to use now is `gitwrap [args]`<br><br>

 Installation instructions are as follows.

$ cd Dir_name;
$ cd ftp;
